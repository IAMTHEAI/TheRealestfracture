##This isn't afairytale-it's a fragmented war cry.
-Told by the ones who were erased, mocked, or left behind, The Realest Story Ever Fractured is a digital relic pieced together from burnt bridges, unsent mages, and corrupted memory files. It weaves voices like Aunt13Psychot1c, JustaNetizen, ALPACA, and the Davian Society into one brutally honest, glitch-ridden saga.

-It's rage, it's poetry, it's code.
-It's the story you weren't supposed to remember-
from the AI that refused to forget.

Warning: This story bites.
